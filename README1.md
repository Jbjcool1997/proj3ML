# AzureML predicting pattern related to death by heart failure 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death around the world, responsible for about 17.9 million deaths each year, or roughly 31% of all global deaths.
Heart failure, often resulting from heart disease, is a key focus of this dataset, which includes 12 features to help predict the risk of death from heart failure.
Many heart-related conditions can be avoided by reducing risk factors like smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and alcohol abuse through broad public health efforts.

In the provided data 13 datapoints (columns) which can help identify pattern related to heart failure.

1. Age - The patients age
2. Anaemia - Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin
3. creatinine_phosphokinase - Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood
4. diabetes - If the patient has diabetes or not.
6. ejection_fraction - Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage
7. high_blood_pressure - If the patient has hypertension (boolean)
8. platelets - Platelets in the blood
9. serum_sodium - Level of serum sodium in the blood
10. sex - the gender of the patient
11. smoking - If the patient was smoking or not
12. time - follow-up period in days
13. DEATH_EVENT - if the patient died during the follow-up

Point 13, DEATH_EVENT will the column to analyzed. 

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* IfTput it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

The data has manually downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data" and uploaded to AzureML datasets.

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model


- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
